# YoutubeTrender

YouTube is a global video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California, United States. The
site allows users to upload, view, rate, share, and comment on videos.
1 Available content includes
video clips, TV clips, music videos, movie trailers, and other content such as video blogging, short
original videos, and educational videos. User can also add a title and description to the videos and
by examining the contents of and detecting which words appear frequently across titles and
descriptions we can detect “trending topics.” See below for more information on YouTube and the
YouTube Data API that generate the list of videos used in this assignment:

YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/yt/about/en-GB/  
Wikipedia on Youtube: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube  
YouTube Data API: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started
YouTube Data API for listing videos: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos/list

### This project is to develop a command line application that can detect the YouTube Trending Topics.
